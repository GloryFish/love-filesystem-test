This is a test project demonstrating the speed difference between lua's native io.open() and LÖVE's love.filesystem.lines() when working with large files.

words.list contains 200,000+ words, one per line.

main.lua is a LÖVE program that loads the file using love.filesystem.lines() and usingio.lua uses io.open().
